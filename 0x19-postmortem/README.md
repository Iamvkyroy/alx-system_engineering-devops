Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: November 10, 2023, 09:00 AM UTC
End Time: November 10, 2023, 11:30 AM UTC
Impact:
Service: API Endpoint for User Authentication
User Experience: 65% of users experienced authentication failures or delays.
Root Cause:

The outage was caused by an unexpected surge in traffic due to a misconfigured update in the authentication service, leading to increased latency and occasional timeouts.

Timeline:

09:15 AM UTC:
Issue detected through increased error rates in authentication logs.
09:20 AM UTC:
Engineering team alerted via monitoring system.
09:30 AM UTC:
Investigated load balancers and database servers assuming a spike in traffic or database overload.
10:00 AM UTC:
Discovered an unusual pattern in API calls related to the authentication service.
10:15 AM UTC:
Incidentally, escalated the incident to the network team due to a suspected DDoS attack.
10:45 AM UTC:
Collaborated with the software development team to identify the misconfiguration in the authentication service.
11:00 AM UTC:
Rolled back the recent update, restoring the service.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The issue stemmed from a misconfiguration in the updated authentication service, causing an unexpected spike in API calls and overwhelming the servers. To resolve the problem, the recent update was rolled back to restore normal service operations.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Immediate Fixes:
Revisit the update deployment process, including rigorous testing before production release.
Enhance monitoring and alerting systems for more proactive anomaly detection.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a thorough review of recent code changes and configurations related to the authentication service.
Implement stricter controls and limits on API usage to prevent similar traffic surges.
Schedule a comprehensive training session for all teams involved to emphasize best practices for system updates and incident response.

Conclusion:

The outage was a result of a configuration oversight during an update, causing significant disruption to the authentication service. Timely detection and collaboration among different teams facilitated a swift resolution. Moving forward, tighter controls, improved monitoring, and enhanced deployment practices will mitigate the risk of similar incidents in the future.

This incident highlighted the importance of robust testing and vigilant monitoring in maintaining service reliability, and the subsequent corrective measures aim to reinforce these aspects for a more resilient system.
